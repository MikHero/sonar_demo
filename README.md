# README

Hello there. This is not exactly what i expected to achieve but never programmed using rails. I chose rails because that's what you guys use as well, no? So better start learning!

Few bullet points:

- The app does not show a search/display results using the data that you provided.I was unable to retrieve the data using the API Key.I even tried using the Homeflow GEM (never heard of a GEM before i started using Ruby of course) but was not sure on the nex step to do after creating the initializer so i gave up. 

The app has has these functionalities: 
 1) Sign Up / Sign In / Edit Profile / Sign Out 
 2) To create a list of homes by filling few fields (Name, Address,Phone,Website) which can then be Edited or Destroyed
 3) When you create a new home you can upload one picture from your PC
 4) The address connects to Google Maps and automatically displays the location 


- Was unable to deploy on heroku (never used it before) because i had to switch database to Postgres and even tho i was following all the steps https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5#database something went wrong. You can see the app in action here: 


I know i have a lot to learn and i'm not sure if you're looking for someone more experienced or skilled but trust me guys, if i start working for you, with a little of support from you during my time at work and long nights outside work practising, great things can be achieved.

Thank you for your time anyway!
